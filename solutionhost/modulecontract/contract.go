// Package modulecontract is the ONE implementation of the module contract —
// codefly/module-contract/v1, the file a module publishes beside its manifest
// as module.contract.codefly.yaml: its Go model, its strict decoder, every
// refusal rule, and the resolution of its slots against a composition. The
// CLI renders an authority document from it, the runtimes publish it, and the
// host's loader reads it: all three read it THROUGH this package, and the
// fixtures it ships (Fixtures) are what each of them is driven through, so a
// decoder that started accepting an invalid ceiling would fail here first and
// everywhere at once. Nothing outside this package may parse or validate a
// module contract.
//
// It lives under solutionhost because the contract is the request the
// authority document grants: the envelope bounds it, the authority document
// the CLI derives from it is signed and delivered to the host, and the host
// activates it — the same lifecycle this directory owns.
//
// The contract is a REQUEST, not a grant. It says what the module asks to be
// able to do on a host: the principal its credentials are issued to, the
// operation bindings it redeems, the queues and namespaces it declares, the
// scope ceilings it contributes, and the destinations it exposes. Three records
// narrow it in order — the host's envelope (the ceiling a platform
// administrator writes), the authority document the render derives from this
// file and the delivery pipeline signs, and an organisation's installation — so
// nothing here is wider than what the module exercises, and nothing here grants
// anything by itself.
//
// Four things never appear in a contract, because they are not the module's to
// assert: tenancy and cross-tenant reach (the envelope is the only record that
// may name an organisation), the approved build digest (the render's: the OCI
// image manifest digest of the container it pins), and the expected workload
// identity (the platform's: it issues SVIDs and owns the trust domain). The
// decoder is strict, so a contract that tries to carry one is refused rather
// than silently honoured.
//
// # Slots
//
// A binding's audience and the resource kind its scopes name are expressed in
// ANOTHER module's vocabulary, which a module repository must not spell. They
// are declared as slots — {from: <group>/<key>} — pointing at a workspace
// configuration value the composition supplies, and the render resolves them
// when it derives the authority document. A slot resolves PUBLIC configuration
// only: an audience and a resource kind are names, and a render carries secrets
// only as references, so a slot that resolves to a secret-classified value fails
// the derivation rather than inlining it into a delivered document. A bare
// string where a slot belongs is a schema error, not a value: a literal audience
// written into a module repository is a coupling across a module boundary that
// should never be accepted silently.
//
// A slot's KEY NAME carries its meaning, because no reader can check what a
// resolved value means: an audience slot pointing at a declared, supplied key
// that holds a model profile name resolves cleanly to a binding addressed to a
// profile, which the receiver refuses far from the contract that caused it. So
// the reader holds the convention the modules publish against: audience takes
// a *-audience key (or a *-prefix one, since a module's prefix is the audience
// a capability for it is addressed to), resource_kind a *-resource-kind key and
// binding_key a *-binding key, in either spelling core accepts.
//
// # Scope ceilings
//
// A binding's ceiling is written per operation in one of two spellings. Bare
// actions ([read, write]) are qualified by the binding's resource_kind slot,
// and a binding declaring none cannot write them: a scope names a resource
// kind, and one without a kind is a request nothing can mint. A binding whose
// acts span several kinds spells each scope out instead —
// [{resource_kind: other.things, actions: [write]}] — naming the kind
// literally, because a permission's namespace is fixed by the module that
// contributes it, exactly as its proto package is, while a service the
// composition chooses is configuration and stays a slot.
