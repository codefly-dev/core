> Fundamentals for the `codefly.ai` ecosystem.

![dragonfly](docs/media/dragonfly.png)

## Shared code

This repository contains the shared code for the CodeFly ecosystem.

## Configuration definition and helpers

Configurations are hierarchical. We use the terminology of reference: a Project has ApplicationReferences.

A reference contains just enough data to load the associated configuration.

### Project

A folder is a project folder if it contains a `project.codefly.yaml` file.



## Templating on steroids

Within `codefly.ai`, we do *a lot* of templating. We add some powerful tools.



### Tips for a Cool README:

1. **Engaging Visuals**: Include badges for build status, code quality, etc., and consider adding a project logo or screenshots/gifs of your project in action.

2. **Clear and Concise**: Make your README easy to read with clear headings and concise descriptions.

3. **Examples**: Include usage examples, as they are extremely helpful to new users.

4. **Contribution Guidelines**: Encourage community involvement with clear contribution guidelines.

5. **License Information**: Always specify the license to inform users about how they can use your project.

6. **Acknowledgments**: Give credit where it's due if you're building upon others' work.

7. **Keep it Updated**: Regularly update the README as your project evolves.

Remember, the README is often the first thing users or potential contributors see, so making it informative, welcoming, and visually appealing can greatly impact the success of your project.
